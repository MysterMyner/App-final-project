### **App Description**
The app will contain everything you need to put down in a D&D character sheet, such as stats, modifiers, and equipments. It will even automatically calculate certain skill proficiencies and let you increase and decrease your health as needed.

**Major Goals**:

    1. Make the layout intuitive to new D&D players
    2. Make it automatically calculate proficient skills, saving throws, spell attack modifiers, and spell save DCs
    3. Add the core races to be even more player friendly
    4. Automatically add racial bonuses to races selected
    5. Make option to create custom character sheet if you don't want to use core races

### **App Architecture**
There will be 4 screens, each pertaining to certain aspects of a D&D character sheet. One screen will contain stats, saving throws, skills, the proficiency bonus, armor class, speed, and saving throws. Depending on the class you choose and what level you are, the app will automatically determine your saving throws. The next screen will be entirely filled by the user and will contain features, traits, proficiencies, equipment, and attacks. The next screen will also be mostly self filled, containing backstory, personality traits, ideals, bonds, flaws, and even alignment. Lastly, the final screen will contain all the spells your character will have, with automatically calculated spell DCs, and spell attack bonus.
